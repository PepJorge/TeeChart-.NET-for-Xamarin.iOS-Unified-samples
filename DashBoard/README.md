DashBoard Demo
==================

This demo shows you how to create a cluster of charts to form a DashBoard.

The code shows how easy it is to create Dashoards for your iOS apps using TeeChart NET and Xamarin.iOS.
The demo uses different types of Series, including the Gauge Series, which can all be completely personalised in look, size and position. It also makes use of the Line and Volume Series.
Create your own DashBoards the way you want in just a few minutes.

In order to try the demo you have Xamarin.iOS installed.
