DashBoard Demo
==================

This demo shows you how to create a cluster of charts to form a DashBoard.

First impressions count, and it’s important to understand data at a quick glance. For this reason dashboards are on the up and becoming increasingly more prevalent in modern data applications. We are also seeing many different types of gauges playing a vital role in dashboard design.

The code shows how easy it is to create Dashoards for your iOS apps using TeeChart NET and Xamarin.iOS.
The demo uses different types of Series, including the Gauge Series, which can all be completely personalised in look, size and position. It also makes use of the Line and Volume Series.
Create your own DashBoards the way you want in just a few minutes.
