Multiple Custom Axes Demo
=========================

Multiple axes can be useful when it is necessary to combine series with the a similar X axis, for example, but different Y axis units or even scales on the same Chart. It's important to be aware that multiple axes on the same Chart might be more difficult to interpret or even misguide the reader. However if there are limitations of space where two separate charts are not possible, multiple axes provide a valid solution. 

This demo shows you how to create multiple custom axes on your charts.
